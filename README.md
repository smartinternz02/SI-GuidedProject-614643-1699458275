# Microbe Mapper: Visual Recognition of Microorganisms ðŸ¦ 

## Overview

Microbe Mapper is an AI-powered model for the visual recognition of microorganisms. Developed by Mohamed Irfan Abdul Khader and Shaik Hamzah Shareef, this model utilizes the InceptionV3 architecture to accurately classify sample images into eight different categories of microorganisms.

## Categories

1. **Amoeba**
   - Unicellular, shape-shifting protist.

2. **Euglena**
   - Single-celled, flagellated protist.

3. **Paramecium**
   - Ciliated protozoan.

4. **Rod Bacteria**
   - Prokaryotic microorganisms with a cylindrical shape.

5. **Hydra**
   - Freshwater, multicellular organism.

6. **Spiral Bacteria**
   - Helical-shaped prokaryotes with a corkscrew motion.

7. **Yeast**
   - Single-celled fungus, often Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

8. **Spherical Bacteria**
   - Round-shaped prokaryotic cells.

## Model Architecture

Microbe Mapper is powered by the InceptionV3 architecture, a deep learning model known for its efficiency in image recognition tasks.

## Usage

To classify a microorganism in a sample image, input the image into the Microbe Mapper model. The model will then provide the classification, indicating the type of microorganism present in the image based on the eight defined categories.
